Level editor is intended for developer use only.

Levels created in the editor must have ONLY an integer filled in in the name section,
the level created will be added to the game levels or replace another level based on the 
integer provided.

Levels can only have one key tile or the file output will fail.

Any location on the level editor that is null will not have any trap.

Ordering a trap at 0 or less will break the level.

You may have a bad time if you mess with the level editor.
